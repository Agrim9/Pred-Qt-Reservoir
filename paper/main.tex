% \section*{APPENDIX}
% \subsection{User Datagram Protocol}
% User Datagram Protocol is an alternative communication protocol to Transmission Control Protocol(TCP).  Both layers are on top of Internet Protocol layer. TCP sends individual packets and is reliable whereas UDP sends messages called datagrams. TCP is more dominant protocol in todayâ€™s internet world because of its ability to break datasets into packets, check for and resend lost packets, and reassemble packets in the correct sequence. But these lead to additional data overhead and latency whereas in UDP packets can take different paths between sender and receiver resulting in some packets getting lost or received out of order. Following are some applications and features of this Protocol: 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Advantageous in applications that can tolerate losing of data
% \item Allows data to be dropped or received out of order making it suitable for real-time applications such as gaming, video conferences etc.
% \end{enumerate}
